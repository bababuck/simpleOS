# simpleOS
Toy OS to run on qemu. I read a couple textbooks, wanted to make something.

Designed for an x86 architecture (wanted RISC-V, but doesn't appear that the BIOS interface is set up for that). Used Nick Blundell's guide (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) to get started.

Plan:

[ ] Download qemu and get simple boot running.

[ ] Write drivers for the keyboard, screen, and disk.

[ ] Create a simple file system

[ ] Create a simple text editor

[ ] Threading?
